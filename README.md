# PerfusionCT-Net
A UNet for the analysis of perfusion CT imaging in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. 


## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##### Compatibility

- Environment must use python 3.7 (for torch and CUDA compatibility)

## Getting started

- The main file for training can be found under `train_segmentation.py`. It takes a config file as argument, examples can be found in the `./config`folder. 
- A visdom server can launched as well for visualisation: `python -m visdom.server`
